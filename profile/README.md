# Vector Hawk

**Vector Hawk** is a focused engineering team building intelligent, high-impact hackathon projects at the intersection of AI, full-stack systems, and rapid product execution.

We are a team of four developers who specialize in turning ideas into working systems — fast, clean, and scalable.

## Our Mission

To design and ship technically sound solutions under competitive constraints while maintaining production-grade standards.
Hackathons aren’t just events for us — they’re execution arenas.


## What We Build

- AI-powered web applications  
- Intelligent automation tools  
- Full-stack platforms (MERN / modern JavaScript stacks)  
- Data-driven systems  
- Rapid MVPs with scalable architecture  

Every repository here represents a sprint of focused engineering effort.


## How We Work

Our approach remains structured even under time pressure:

1. Problem decomposition & feasibility validation  
2. Architecture planning (frontend, backend, data flow)  
3. Parallel development  
4. Integration, testing & debugging  
5. Deployment-ready delivery  

We prioritize:
- Clean code  
- Logical architecture  
- Performance efficiency  
- Real-world usability  

## Tech Stack

Depending on project scope, we work with:

- React / Next.js  
- Node.js / Express  
- MongoDB / SQL  
- Python (AI & ML workflows)  
- Firebase / Supabase  
- Modern deployment pipelines  

## Ongoing Focus

- Competitive hackathon participation  
- Applied AI problem-solving  
- Scalable system design  
- Product-oriented engineering  

**Small team. Sharp focus. Relentless execution.**
